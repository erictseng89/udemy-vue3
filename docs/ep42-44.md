## v-show directive
The v-show directive is also a conditional statement similar to v-if. The difference is
that the v-if directive controls whether the element will render, while the v-show
directive simply uses the css 'visible' style to display or hide an element. In the
browser, a hidden v-if element will not appera in the developer tools, but a hidden v-show
element will, but just with visible: hidden.

It is advised that we use v-if most of the time, and only use v-show if there is an
element that will be frequently toggled visible or hidden.

```html
<p v-show="goals.length === 0">No goals have been added yet - please start adding some!</p>
<ul v-show="goals.length > 0">
```
## v-for additional parameters
There are additional parameters for v-for for both array and object loops as well as numbers.

- array loops can have a second variable that becomes the index number.
  ```html
  <div v-for="(value, index = null) in array">
  ```

- object loops by default will output the values of each key, but can have additional
  variables for both the key, and the index.
  ```html
  <div v-for="(value, key = null, index = null) in object">
  ```
  
- You can also loop through numbers with v-for
  ```html
  <div v-for="num in 10">
  ```
