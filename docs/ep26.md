## v-model="property" directive
This is a very powerful directive within view. The element that has this directive will
have the following:
1. The value of this element is synced, meaning that if the property in the model is
   changed, the value of this element will change along with it.
1. If the value of the element is changed on an 'input' event, the property will change as
   well
1. This change will also automatically trigger a change in other elements using this
   property.

We can change from:
```html
<input type="text"
  v-bind:value="confirmedName"
  v-on:keypress="enterName" />
<button v-on:click="resetName">Reset Name</button>
<p>Your Name: {{ confirmedName }}</p>
```
to:
```html
<input type="text"
  v-model="confirmedName" />
<button v-on:click="resetName">Reset Name</button>
<p>Your Name: {{ confirmedName }}</p>
```
