## Watcher
A watcher is a function that executes when one of its properties change. It('watch') is also
one of the name-reserved objects in a vue app along side 'data', 'computed', and methods'.

```javascript
data() {
  return {
    counter: 10,
    name: '',
    confirmedName: '',
  }
},
watch: {
  counter(value) {
    if (value > 50) {
      this.counter = 0;
    };
  },
},
```

## Summary
1. methods should be used either event binding, or for data-binding {{ method() }} if the
   data-binding is to re-execute for every re-render of the component.
2. computer properties used for data-binding, and will only be reevaluated if one of their dependent data property has changed.
3. watchers should not be used directly in the template, but should execute code in the
   background in the event of a data change.
