## v-once directive
This is a niche directive which declares that any dynamic data binding in the element will
only occur once. 

```html
<button v-on:click="addCounter(3)">Add</button>
<button v-on:click="removeCounter(4)">Remove</button>
<p v-once>result: {{ counter }}</p>
<p>result: {{ counter }}</p>
```
In this example, the first counter with v-once will remain at its initial value and not
change.
