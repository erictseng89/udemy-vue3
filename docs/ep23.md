## the 'input' event
This is a vanilla event listener that triggers on a input element. For a type=text input,
the input event is triggered at every keystroke.
```javascript
v-on:input="setName"
```
## the default event object
There is a default 'event' object that can be referred to whenever an event is triggered.
It can be used thereafter in the function that was linked to the event listener.

Vue can also use event and its property: event.target.
```javascript
setName() {
  this.name = event.target.value;
}
```

```html
<input type="text"
  v-on:input="setName" />
```

Note that the 'event' parameter can be omitted from both the calling of the app and the
definition. Although it is slightly better convention to define the parameter in the
method.

Vue will only change the elements that were changed.

## $event reserved word
Adding additional parameters to the method whilst using 'event'

```html
<input type="text"
  v-on:input="setName('Ted')" />
```

```javascript
setName(lastName) {
  this.name = event.target.value + ' ' + lastName;
}
```

This will still work without passing the event parameter, althought it is better to pass
it in anyway using the reserved 'event' name $event in html, and assigning the parameter
in the function.

```html
<input type="text"
  v-on:input="setName($event, 'Ted')" />
```

```javascript
setName(event, lastName) {
  this.name = event.target.value + ' ' + lastName;
}
```
