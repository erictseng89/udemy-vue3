## Defining where an app instance will be
Usually with an id on the parent element of the app, and then use the .mount('selector')
method to define where to run the app.

## The data() {} parameter
This function MUST return an object. Each key/pair in the object will become a property of
the vue app.

## Interpolation in html
The double curly {{ }} allows for interpolation which means you can reference methods and
properties of the app if it is in the vue app.

```html
<section id="user-goal">
    <h2>My Course Goal</h2>
    <p>{{ courseGoal }}</p>
</section>
```
NOTE: The {{ }} only works if it is in the textcontent of elements. It does not work
inside html tags.

## v-bind directive
A directive is an instruction for vue inside on element's tag. This particular attribute
binds to a tag attribute. It informs the vue app that the contents will be interpolated.
In this example it is a property of the vue app.

```html
<p><a href="{{ vueLink }}">Link</a></p> will not work

<p><a v-bind:href="vueLink">Link</a></p> must bind with v-bind:
```
The parenthesis can simply contain the name of the property, without the double curly
{{}}.
