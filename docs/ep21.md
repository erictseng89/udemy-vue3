## We should not add in javascript expressions in html
Instead we should create functions in the app instead

```javascript
methods: {
  addCounter() {
    this.counter++;
  },
  removeCounter() {
    this.counter--;
  }
}
```

Both of these iterations will work:
```html
<button v-on:click="addCounter">Add</button>
<button v-on:click="removeCounter">Remove</button>

<button v-on:click="addCounter()">Add</button>
<button v-on:click="removeCounter()">Remove</button>
```
Since the event listener method in javascript can only contain functions and are without
(), it is slightly more conventional to omit the brackets in v-on.

Due to this, it is inadvisable to have properties and methods that have the same name as
it will produce an error even when explicitly called as a () function.
