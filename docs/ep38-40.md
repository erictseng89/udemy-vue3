## Module introduction
- Rendering content with conditions
- Outputting Lists of data


## v-if directive
The v-if="condition" is a conditional directive that when met, will cause the element to
be rendered. If the "condition" is unmet, the element and it's child elements will not be
rendered. In the browser, the location will have a comment at the location of the
unrendered v-if element.

In this example, the p element will only be rendered if the array goals has a length/index
of 0.
```html
<p v-if="goals.length === 0">No goals have been added yet - please start adding some!</p>
```

## Adding input into array

We use v-model and @click to add user input into an array.
```html
<input type="text"
  v-model="enteredGoalsValue" />
<button @click="addGoals">Add Goal</button>
```
```javascript
const app = Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      goals: [],
      enteredGoalsValue: '',
    };
  },
  methods: {
    addGoals() {
      this.goals.push(this.enteredGoalsValue);
    }
  }
```
