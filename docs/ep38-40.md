## Module introduction
- Rendering content with conditions
- Outputting Lists of data


## v-if directive
The v-if="condition" is a conditional directive that when met, will cause the element to
be rendered. If the "condition" is unmet, the element and it's child elements will not be
rendered.

In this example, the p element will only be rendered if the array goals has a length/index
of 0.
```html
<p v-if="goals.length === 0">No goals have been added yet - please start adding some!</p>
```

## Adding input into array

We use v-model and @click to add user input into an array.
```html
<input type="text"
  v-model="enteredGoalsValue" />
<button @click="addGoals">Add Goal</button>
```
```javascript
const app = Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      goals: [],
      enteredGoalsValue: '',
    };
  },
  methods: {
    addGoals() {
      this.goals.push(this.enteredGoalsValue);
    }
  }
```

## v-else and v-else-if directive
The v-else and v-else-if operate the same as in javascript, that they will check and
execute if the initial v-if statement is falsy. Note that the v-else and v-else-if
statements must be in elements that is right below the v-if element. 

```html
<p v-if="goals.length === 0">No goals have been added yet - please start adding some!</p>
<ul v-else>
  <li>Goal</li>
</ul>
```
